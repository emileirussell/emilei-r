        <h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Emilei, its pronounced like “emily” I moved to the central Indiana region a year ago, I am originally from Peru, Indiana. 
I am a self made self taught business owner. Ive been artistically inclined since I was a kid, and knew one day I wanted to work doing something with art. I have also always loved helping people, and a newfound passion is helping businesses change their image, improving their communication, and media presence. I decided to do some research and launched my business in January 2025.
as of recently, I decided to study technology, focusing in web design, with hopes to be able to add technology services to my business.
