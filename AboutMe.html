    <div class="aboutme">
<p id="aboutmep">Hi! My name is Emilei. Its pronounced like “Emily.” I recently moved to the central Indiana area, though I am originally from Peru, Indiana. One of the things I’m most proud of is being a self-taught, self-made business owner, something made possible by the encouragement and support of the people around me.
I've been passionate about art since I was a child and always dreamed of building a career in a creative industry. I’ve also had a lifelong desire to help others, and more recently, I discovered a passion for supporting businesses by enhancing their branding, communication, and media presence.
After a lot of research and planning, I officially launched my business in January 2025. Since then, I have begun studying technology with a focus on web design, with the goal of expanding my services to include tech solutions in the near future. I’ll be sharing updates on this journey, so stay tuned on my Facebook!</p>
