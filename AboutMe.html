         <h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Emilei, its pronounced like “emily”. I moved to the central Indiana region a year ago, I am originally from Peru, Indiana. <br>
Something I take pride in is that I am a self made self taught business owner. This is all thanks to encouragement from the people in my circle. <br> 
Ive been artistically inclined since I was a kid, and knew one day I wanted to work doing something with art. I have also always loved helping people, and a newfound passion is helping businesses change their image, improving their communication, and media presence. 
<br>
So, I decided to do some research and launched my business in January 2025. 
<br>
As of recently, I decided to study technology, focusing in web design, with hopes to be able to add technology services to my business. Updates on this will be shared on my Facebook.
